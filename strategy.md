# Stateless Calendar Chat Agent Strategy

## Project Overview

A Next.js web application that provides an intelligent chat interface powered by real-time Google Calendar data. The app is completely stateless - no database required. Authentication uses NextAuth.js sessions, calendar data is fetched fresh from Google APIs, and chat history is maintained client-side only.

## Authentication Strategy

### Google OAuth 2.0 Implementation

- **Library**: NextAuth.js with Google provider
- **Scopes Required**:
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` - Read calendar events
  - `openid`, `email`, `profile` - Basic user info

### Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
3. User grants calendar read permissions
4. Store access/refresh tokens securely
5. Implement token refresh mechanism for long-term access

### Security Considerations

- NextAuth.js handles secure session management automatically
- No persistent user data storage eliminates data breach risks
- Tokens managed by NextAuth.js with automatic refresh
- Read-only calendar access minimizes security risk
- Stateless architecture reduces attack surface

## Frontend Development Strategy

### UI/UX Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for clean, modern design
- **Components**: Modular React components with TypeScript
- **Focus**: Conversational interface with minimal distractions

### Key Frontend Components

#### 1. Chat Interface (Primary Focus)

- **Open Source Powered** Use the assistant-ui package (https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui) as well as shadcn
- **Full-Screen Chat**: Clean, messaging app-style interface
- **Real-time Responses**: WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for live AI responses
- **Message History**: Persistent conversation storage with search
- **Typing Indicators**: Visual feedback during AI processing
- **Rich Message Support**: Formatted responses, suggested actions
- **Context Awareness**: Display relevant calendar insights inline

#### 2. Minimal Header/Navigation

- **User Profile**: Simple authentication status and settings
- **Session Management**: Start new conversations, access history
- **Minimal Chrome**: Keep focus on chat interaction

#### 3. Optional Calendar Context Panel (Collapsible)

- **Quick Calendar Summary**: Today's schedule at a glance
- **Upcoming Events**: Next few events for context
- **Meeting Stats**: High-level analytics when relevant
- **Toggleable**: Can be hidden to focus purely on chat

### State Management

- **NextAuth.js Session**: Authentication state and Google tokens
- **React State**: Chat messages stored only in component state
- **Local Storage**: Optional chat history persistence (client-side only)
- **No Server State**: All data fetched fresh from Google APIs each session

## Backend Development Strategy

### API Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js API routes (App Router)
- **Session Management**: NextAuth.js (no database required)
- **No Persistence**: All data fetched real-time from Google APIs
- **Caching**: Optional in-memory caching during user session only

### Core API Endpoints

#### Authentication APIs (NextAuth.js)

```
GET  /api/auth/[...nextauth] - NextAuth.js handlers
GET  /api/auth/session - Current user session with Google tokens
```

#### Calendar Data APIs (Real-time)

```
GET  /api/calendar/events - Fetch fresh calendar events from Google
GET  /api/calendar/analytics - Real-time meeting analysis
GET  /api/calendar/availability - Live free/busy analysis
```

#### Chat APIs (Stateless)

```
POST /api/chat/message - Process message with fresh calendar context
```

### AI Integration Strategy

#### Language Model Integration

- **Primary**: OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude API
- **Fallback**: Local/open-source model for basic queries
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation context with calendar data

#### AI Agent Capabilities

1. **Calendar Analysis**: Parse and understand calendar patterns and availability
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Understand scheduling questions in conversational language
3. **Meeting Insights**: Provide analysis on meeting load, patterns, and productivity
4. **Scheduling Recommendations**: Suggest optimal meeting times and schedule improvements
5. **Time Management Coaching**: Offer insights on calendar optimization and work-life balance
6. **Availability Analysis**: Help users understand their free time and scheduling conflicts
7. **Meeting Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring themes, heavy meeting days, etc.

### Google Calendar API Integration

#### Real-time Calendar Data

- **Live Events Retrieval**: Fetch events directly from Google for each request
- **Fresh Availability**: Real-time free/busy analysis
- **No Caching**: Always work with current calendar state
- **Multi-Calendar Support**: Access all user calendars in real-time
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling to respect Google API limits

### Data Layer Strategy

#### No Database Required

- **NextAuth.js**: Handles authentication and session management
- **Google APIs**: Source of truth for all calendar data
- **Client-Side Storage**: Optional local storage for chat history
- **Memory Only**: Temporary data processing during request lifecycle

#### Session-Based Architecture

```javascript
// Example session structure (managed by NextAuth.js)
session = {
  user: { email, name },
  accessToken: "google_access_token",
  refreshToken: "google_refresh_token",
  expires: timestamp,
};

// Chat messages stored client-side only
chatHistory = [
  { role: "user", content: "How busy am I today?", timestamp },
  { role: "assistant", content: "Based on your calendar...", timestamp },
];
```
